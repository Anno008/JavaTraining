# Fullstack project

The project is made of two sperate projects. Backend, which is a java project that uses spring framework. And on the frontend side we have react that forwads http request to the backend.

# Backend

  - The easiest way to install the required dependencies is to open the backend in Eclipse after which, eclipse will pull and build the project. Then just go to run as java application which will start the rest web service on port 8080.

# Frontend
  - To be able to run the react application you will need to have node installed. Using node package manager (npm). In the root of frontened type npm install which will pull all the required dependencies defined in package.json. After that type npm start which will start the node dev server on port 3000
